    <h1 id="up">French Bulldog</h1>

    <p> The French Bulldog is a breed of domestic dog. In the 1800s, they were the result of a cross between Toy
        Bulldogs imported from England and local ratters in Paris, France.
        The breed is popular as a pet; in 2015, they were the fourth-most popular registered dog in the United Kingdom,
        and in the U.S., the sixth-most popular AKC-registered dog breed. They were rated the third-most popular dog in
        Australia in 2017.
