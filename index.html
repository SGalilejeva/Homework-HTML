    <h1 id="up">French Bulldog</h1>

    <p> The French Bulldog is a breed of domestic dog. In the 1800s, they were the result of a cross between Toy
        Bulldogs imported from England and local ratters in Paris, France.

        The breed is popular as a pet; in 2015, they were the fourth-most popular registered dog in the United Kingdom,
        and in the U.S., the sixth-most popular AKC-registered dog breed. They were rated the third-most popular dog in
        Australia in 2017.

        <h2>
            History!
        </h2>

        <p>The origin of the modern French Bulldog breed descends directly from the dogs of the Molossians, an ancient
            Greek tribe. The dogs were spread throughout the ancient world by Phoenician traders. British Molossian dogs
            were developed into the English Mastiff, a sub-breed of the Mastiff was the Bullenbeisser, a type of dog
            used for bull-baiting.
            Bulldogs were very popular in the past, especially in Western Europe. One of its ancestors was the English
            bulldog. Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were
            brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society
            ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896. They arrived again in the
            following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future
            ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, a Mr. George Raper, only chose winners with "rose
            ears" ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs. The ladies formed the French Bull Dog
            Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the "erect bat ear" was
            the correct type.
